  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Lab1_Windows            Was tasked to make a    When I was trying to
                          folder to store the     check the properties
                          files and subfolders    for some reason I
                          for the activity and    didn't have the
                          was tasked to see if it security tab on it but
                          can be shared, it was   when I checked the
                          also tasked to be       others they have it, I
                          compressed and          tried trouble shooting
                          extracted to a          it like transferring it
                          different folder        to a different drive
                                                  but it still didn't
                                                  work. I also
                                                  encountered a problem
                                                  when I was trying to
                                                  extract it, I can't
                                                  left click or right
                                                  click the "rar" file so
                                                  I had to download a
                                                  third party application
                                                  to do so.

  LabFIles                Was tasked to make a    There was no issue when
                          subfolder for           I was making this
                          Lab1_Windows for the    folder, it went
                          activity and to be the  smoothly as it should
                          folder of 4 more        and I had moved on
                          subfolders, these were  quicker than the other
                          the Audio, Images, Text tasks
                          and Video.              

  Audio                   Was tasked to add 2     It went smoothly while
                          audio files which were  I was trying to do this
                          the mp3 file and the    task but I had a bit of
                          wav file.               problem when I was
                                                  trying to find a wav
                                                  file because its new to
                                                  me so I did a bit of
                                                  research and found the
                                                  site VoIP
                                                  TroubleShooter and it
                                                  turns out a wav is a
                                                  open speech repository.

  Images                  Was tasked to put 3     Download the jpg and
                          kinds of image files    png image was easy but
                          and these were png, jpg trying to find the bmp
                          and bmp.                image was a bit
                                                  challenging because I
                                                  couldn't find one on
                                                  the browser so I tried
                                                  to look for it in the
                                                  file explorer and found
                                                  the Bitmap image and it
                                                  turns out it was the
                                                  bmp image.

  Text                    Was tasked to make 3    The large_text and
                          text files which was    small_text was easy to
                          the large_text,         do but the code part
                          small_text and code.    was a bit tricky
                                                  because its not
                                                  code.txt its code.cpp,
                                                  so what I had to do was
                                                  save the .txt to .cpp.

  Video                   Was tasked to download  This was easy to do
                          an mp4 file and to be   because I only had to
                          put in the folder.      download it in the
                                                  internet.

  Changing file           Was tasked to explore,  When I changed the
  properties              try and change the      attribute to Read-only
                          attributes of the file  for some reason I can
                          info.txt .              still type when I
                                                  opened the file in the
                                                  notepad and when I
                                                  changed the attribute
                                                  into Hidden it
                                                  disappeared from the
                                                  folder.
