3.  Test and Report Findings:

    -   Generate a report or dashboard from the tool.

> **-So far with this app I can see the name of the document that is
> printed, the date that it was printed, the status, number of pages,
> the day it was submitted and the printer that was used on the
> document. This is only free but with these features I think I can
> manage my server with users in it especially because I can monitor
> their printing Queues through this application and also their
> computers.**

-   Analyze the collected data (e.g., print volume, errors, user
    > activity).
