**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  My expectations was more on with emphasis on useful tools and concepts,
  I expected this from SYSADM1 because I wanted it to offer a fundamental
  understanding of system administration. By providing practical
  experience with subjects like maintaining Git repositories, setting up
  Kerberos, and managing Windows servers, the course went beyond my
  expectations.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I think for me the main topics were Web servers, Windows administrative
  tools, and Git and GitHub repositories. Git and GitHub improved my
  version control and teamwork abilities, while learning about web
  servers gave me insights into hosting and running online businesses. I
  gained a better understanding of fundamental system management chores
  thanks to Windows Administrative Tools, which increased my confidence
  in managing actual IT situations.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I think the best approach was the hands-on practice, particularly when
  it came to handling Git repositories and installing web servers. While
  collaborating with my classmates and going over real-world case
  studies, this strengthened my comprehension and learning of the of the
  topics.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  For me the web server setup and monitoring effort was the most helpful.
  It enabled me to merge several abilities, such using Windows
  Administrative Tools and platform services, which enhanced my overall
  ability as an IT student and also helped me exercise my knowledge with
  real-world applications.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  One major challenge was troubleshooting issues in web server
  configurations. I overcame this by using online documentation, seeking
  advice from peers, and applying trial-and-error methods. This taught me
  the importance of critical thinking and persistence in problem-solving.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, by challenging us to analyze system problems and put solutions in
  place, the course encouraged critical thinking. As an example,
  identifying Kerberos authentication required determining what was
  wrong, considering choices, and implementing repairs, which promoted
  both analytical and decision-making abilities.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I gained technical skills in configuring and managing web servers, and
  employing Windows Administrative Tools for system management. I also
  gained a deeper understanding of how important secure authentication
  methods like Kerberos are to preserving system integrity.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I want to use these abilities in next IT projects, especially when it
  comes to server management and working with Git repositories. In order
  to effectively contribute to technical and team-based work, these
  skills will be crucial to my career as a future IT professional.
