**Part 2. Network Scalability Analysis**

Recall the e-commerce website scenario we discussed earlier. Given the
expected surge in traffic, analyze the provided network topology
diagram. Identify potential bottlenecks and areas where scalability
might be a concern. Propose specific strategies to improve the
network\'s scalability and performance to ensure a seamless user
experience during the peak traffic period. Consider factors such as
increased user demand, new applications, and security threats.

> In the improved topology, key potential bottlenecks include the
> dependence on the 3560 Multilayer Switch and Edge Routers for
> inter-VLAN and internet-bound traffic, as these components centralize
> data flow. While redundancy has been introduced via the primary and
> standby edge routers, the connections between the VLAN-specific
> switches (e.g., VLAN 10, VLAN 20, etc.) and the core devices may
> experience congestion during peak usage due to the limited uplink
> bandwidth. Furthermore, security risks such as unauthorized access or
> VLAN hopping persist without robust configurations like Access Control
> Lists (ACLs) and port-based security.\
> \
> To ensure scalability and optimal performance, it is recommended to
> upgrade the core switches to higher-capacity devices supporting
> multi-gigabit links and implement Link Aggregation Protocol (LACP) for
> increased bandwidth on uplinks. Introducing software-defined
> networking (SDN) can enhance traffic management and resource
> allocation dynamically. Additionally, inter-VLAN routing can be
> improved by enabling Layer 3 routing capabilities on all distribution
> switches, reducing the dependency on the core for routing. While these
> upgrades might increase initial costs, the benefits include better
> fault tolerance, reduced congestion, and improved security---essential
> for supporting growing user demands and new applications in the
> network.
