# Portfolio for SYSADM1

Welcome to my **Portfolio for SYSADM1**! This repository showcases my work and progress in **Systems Administration 1** as part of my **Information Technology** coursework.

## About the Project

This portfolio is a collection of assignments, projects, and documentation that highlight my journey in **Systems Administration 1** at the **University of Baguio**. Between **November 28 and December 8**, I worked on updates both at home and in school, ensuring consistent progress. Maintaining and committing projects to GitHub was a crucial part of the course, as we were being graded for it while providing practical experience with repository management. This activity did not only made me demonstrate my ability to meet academic requirements but also allowed me to develop essential skills in systems administration and collaborative workflows.

# My learnings 

- I learned how to use GitHub effectively, including committing, updating, and managing repositories. This experience emphasized the importance of version control in tracking changes and collaborating on projects.
- By maintaining, making and documenting a portfolio and my projects, I developed skills in organizing my work and creating clear records of my progress, which is important for system administrators.
- Updating projects both at home and school over a specific timeline taught me how to manage my time efficiently and balance multiple tasks.
- Through my assignments and projects, I learned foundational concepts in systems administration, such as managing systems, troubleshooting, and understanding network or server environments.
- Regular updates and the need to commit work properly on GitHub helped sharpen my attention to detail, as even small mistakes could affect projects.
- The hands-on experience of uploading and maintaining a GitHub repository gave me real-world experience in using tools that are widely utilized in the tech industry.
